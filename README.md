# solar-system
[This post](https://thepythoncodingbook.com/2021/12/11/simulating-3d-solar-system-python-matplotlib/) describes a really neat little implementation of a solar system simulation built from first principles.  The system described works in standalone mode using `matplotlib` as a canvas. The `jupyter` notebook [here](https://github.com/malminhas/solar-system/blob/main/solar-system-playbook.ipynb) tries to interleave an explanatoin with a version of the code that runs as a basic animation using a `juptyer-matplotlib` canvas class. The implementation opens the possibility of implementations targetting other environments.  Note that `%matplotlib widget` (aka `ipympl` or `interactive) support doesn't seem to be working properly in the local setup so this notebook is leveraging `%matplotlib inline` support via a `JupyterMatplotlibCanvas` which is not interactive.
